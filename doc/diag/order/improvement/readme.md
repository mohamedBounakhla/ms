ðŸš€ High Priority - Core Trading Features
1. Order Types Enhancement
   Current State: Limit orders only
   Missing Rules:

// Market Orders
- Execute immediately at best available price
- No price validation required
- Immediate fill or reject logic
- Slippage calculation and limits

// Stop Orders (Stop-Loss/Stop-Limit)
- Trigger price activation rules
- Conversion to market/limit order upon trigger
- Stop price validation (must be worse than current market)

// Time-in-Force Orders
- Good-Till-Cancelled (GTC) - default behavior
- Good-Till-Date (GTD) - expire at specific datetime
- Immediate-or-Cancel (IOC) - execute immediately, cancel remainder
- Fill-or-Kill (FOK) - execute completely or cancel entirely

Implementation Impact: Medium complexity, requires new order type hierarchy


2. Market Data Integration Rules
   Current State: Orders exist independently of market data
   Missing Rules:

// Price Validation Against Market
- Collar checks (max % deviation from last traded price)
- Minimum price increment (tick size) validation
- Price reasonableness checks

// Market Hours Validation
- Trading session validation (pre-market, regular, after-hours)
- Symbol-specific trading calendar
- Holiday and weekend restrictions

Implementation Impact: Low-Medium complexity, requires market data dependency

3. Order Size and Value Constraints
   Current State: Basic positive quantity validation
   Missing Rules:

// Size Constraints
- Minimum order value (e.g., $1 minimum)
- Maximum order size per symbol
- Lot size requirements (some stocks trade in 100-share lots)
- Fractional share support for certain assets

// Economic Constraints
- Notional value limits
- Position concentration limits
- Daily trading volume limits per user

Implementation Impact: Low complexity, straightforward validation rules

4. Risk Management Rules

- Modification impact on queue position

// Advanced Lifecycle
- Order expiration handling
- Automatic cancellation triggers
- Order prioritization in queue
- Order routing decisions

Implementation Impact: Medium complexity, requires state machine enhancement

7. Algorithmic Order Features
   Current State: Simple order execution

- Refresh logic when display quantity filled
- Randomization to avoid detection

// TWAP/VWAP Orders
