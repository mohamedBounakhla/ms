🚀 Market Simulator - Domain-First Development Roadmap
📋 Project Overview
This roadmap outlines the domain-first development strategy for the Market Simulator project, focusing on pure business logic implementation before adding infrastructure layers.
🎯 Development Philosophy
Core Principles

Domain-First: Business logic before infrastructure
Pure Domain Models: No framework dependencies in domain layer
Test-Driven Development: Business rules expressed through comprehensive tests
Bounded Context Isolation: Each domain develops independently
Clean Architecture Ready: Foundation for hexagonal/clean architecture

Benefits

✅ Focus on Business Logic without infrastructure distractions
✅ Clean Dependencies - domain remains pure
✅ Easy Testing - no mocking of infrastructure
✅ Flexible Architecture - can choose persistence/UI later
✅ Professional Practices - follows DDD best practices

🛠️ Development Guidelines
TDD Workflow Per Iteration

📝 Document Business Rules - Write clear rule specifications
🧪 Write Failing Tests - Express rules as test scenarios
💚 Implement Minimum Code - Make tests pass with simplest implementation
🔄 Refactor - Improve design while keeping tests green
📚 Document - Update documentation with implemented rules
