Order Bounded Context - Description
📌 Overview
The Order Bounded Context is a core domain component responsible for managing the complete lifecycle of trading orders and recording transactions in a financial trading system. It operates as a pure event-driven microservice within a larger monolithic application, receiving commands exclusively from the Market Engine and publishing events about state changes.
🎯 Core Responsibilities
1. Order Management

Creates buy and sell orders with validation (price, quantity, symbol, portfolio, reservation)
Tracks order states through their lifecycle: PENDING → PARTIAL → FILLED or CANCELLED
Updates order prices when market conditions change
Cancels orders (fully or partially) based on user requests or market conditions
Maintains execution tracking (executed quantity vs remaining quantity)

2. Transaction Recording

Records matched trades when buy and sell orders are executed
Captures execution details (price, quantity, both parties involved)
Maintains immutable transaction history for audit and settlement
Links transactions to their originating buy/sell orders

3. Event Publishing
Publishes domain events to Market Engine for system-wide coordination:

OrderCreatedEvent - When new orders enter the system
OrderCancelledEvent - When orders are cancelled
OrderUpdatedEvent - When order parameters change
OrderPartiallyFilledEvent - When orders are partially executed
OrderFilledEvent - When orders are completely executed
TransactionCreatedEvent - When trades are recorded

🔄 How It Works
Market Engine → [Command Event] → Order BC → [Domain Event] → Market Engine
                                      ↓
                                   Database

Receives command events from Market Engine only (CreateOrder, CancelOrder, etc.)
Validates business rules using domain factories and validators
Executes state changes on domain entities
Persists changes to database
Publishes result events back to Market Engine

🚫 What It Does NOT Do

No direct API access - No REST endpoints for business operations
No order matching - Doesn't decide which orders should trade
No balance validation - Doesn't check if users have sufficient funds
No direct BC communication - Never talks directly to Portfolio or OrderBook BCs
No business orchestration - Doesn't coordinate multi-step workflows
No authorization - Assumes Market Engine has already authorized operations

🔗 Integration Points
Inbound (Commands from Market Engine)

CreateOrderEvent - Create new buy/sell orders
CancelOrderEvent - Cancel entire orders
CancelPartialOrderEvent - Cancel partial quantities
UpdateOrderPriceEvent - Modify order prices
CreateTransactionEvent - Record matched trades

Outbound (Events to Market Engine)

All order state changes
All transaction creations
Used by Market Engine to orchestrate other BCs

Query Interface (For Other BCs)
Since it's monolithic, other BCs can directly call query methods:

findActiveOrdersBySymbol() - OrderBook BC uses this
findOrderById() - For order lookups
getTransactionStatistics() - For analytics

💡 Key Design Principles

Reservation-Based: Orders require portfolioId and reservationId, meaning funds are pre-reserved
Event-Driven: All commands come via events, all changes published as events
State Machine: Orders follow strict state transitions with validation
Immutable Transactions: Transaction records cannot be modified after creation
Domain-Rich: Business logic encapsulated in domain entities and factories

📊 Business Value
The Order BC provides:

Reliable order management with guaranteed state consistency
Complete audit trail of all trading activities
Real-time event notifications for system-wide coordination
Query capabilities for reporting and analytics
Clean separation of order management from other concerns

🏗️ Technical Implementation

Architecture: Hexagonal (Ports & Adapters)
Layers: Domain → Application → Infrastructure
Patterns: Factory, State, Repository, Event-Driven
Persistence: JPA with separate tables for buy/sell orders and transactions
Communication: Spring Events (can be replaced with RabbitMQ/Kafka)

This bounded context essentially acts as the "record keeper" of the trading system, maintaining the authoritative source of all orders and executed trades while remaining completely agnostic to business decisions, which are handled by the Market Engine.
