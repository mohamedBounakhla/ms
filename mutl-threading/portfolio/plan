Transaction & Threading Plan Per Bounded Context
1. Portfolio BC - Critical Section
Transaction Requirements:

MUST ensure atomic reservation creation/release
MUST prevent double-spending (two orders draining same balance)
MUST maintain consistency between available and reserved balances
SHOULD handle compensation in same transaction when possible

Threading Concerns:
Thread-1: User A places BUY order for $500
Thread-2: User A places SELL order for $300
Thread-3: User A cancels previous order
All accessing same portfolio simultaneously!
Strategy:

Use pessimistic locking on Portfolio aggregate
Single transaction boundary for reservation operations
Row-level locks in database
Synchronization on portfolio operations

2. Order BC - State Management
Transaction Requirements:

MUST ensure order creation is atomic
MUST maintain order state transitions consistency
SHOULD be idempotent for duplicate events
CAN use eventual consistency for non-critical updates

Threading Concerns:
Thread-1: Creates Order-123
Thread-2: Updates Order-123 status
Thread-3: Matches Order-123
Potential state conflicts!
Strategy:

Use optimistic locking with version fields
Separate read and write operations
State machine pattern for valid transitions
Event sourcing for audit trail

3. OrderBook BC - Matching Engine
Transaction Requirements:

MUST ensure matching is deterministic
MUST prevent double-matching
SHOULD maintain price-time priority
CAN batch matches for performance

Threading Concerns:
Thread-1: Adds BUY @ $100
Thread-2: Adds SELL @ $99
Thread-3: Running matching algorithm
Critical race condition in price discovery!
Strategy:

Single-threaded matching per instrument
Lock-free data structures for order book
Partitioning by symbol if needed
Sequential processing of match events

Critical Considerations for Spring Events

Transaction Participation:

Spring events are synchronous by default
Event handlers execute in the same thread
They can participate in the same transaction


ThreadLocal Correlation:

Your EventContext ThreadLocal works perfectly with synchronous events
Be careful if you switch to @Async - correlation will be lost


Failure Handling:

Exceptions in event handlers will rollback the entire transaction
Use @TransactionalEventListener for after-commit events
Consider REQUIRES_NEW for compensation handlers
