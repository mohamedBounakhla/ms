üìù Note: Portfolio Business Operations for Later Implementation
Context
These operations require external market data and should be implemented once the full system is running. They might be better suited as domain services or through an extensible mechanism rather than directly in the Portfolio aggregate.
Operations to Implement Later:
1. Portfolio Valuation

getTotalPortfolioValue() - Calculate total value across all assets and cash
Requires: Current market prices for all held assets
Challenge: Needs real-time market data integration

2. Portfolio Composition Analysis

getPortfolioAllocation() - Percentage breakdown of each asset
getCashPercentage() - Cash vs invested ratio
Requires: Current market prices to calculate percentages by value

3. P&L Calculations

getTotalUnrealizedPnL() - Total profit/loss across all positions
getPositionPnL(Symbol) - P&L for specific position
Requires: Current market prices vs average cost basis

4. Exposure Analysis

getExposureValue(Symbol) - Current market value of a position
getConcentrationRisk() - Identify over-concentrated positions
Requires: Market prices and risk thresholds

Design Considerations:

These might be better as Domain Services that take Portfolio + MarketData
Could use Strategy Pattern for different valuation methods
Consider Read Model/CQRS for these query-heavy operations
Maybe implement as Portfolio Extensions or Portfolio Analytics module

Current Focus:
Stick to core portfolio operations that only need internal state:

Order placement/execution
Reservation management
Cash/Asset balance queries
Trade execution flow
